The Two Sum problem from leet code questions are from Arrays.

The question is given below.

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]


Now the problem defines the nums and target and return the indexes of the list which actually meets the target.

So lets take the example 1:


Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].


The nums list have 4 integers and the output target is 9. So the sum of the integers should match the target and the condition is only one exact solution is available for this problem. 

So lets consider the first number from list as current value
here exp is the expected value and if find the expected value in the list then we find the answer.

cur + exp = target
exp = target - cur

exp = 9 - 2
exp = 7

So we see that 7 is the expected value, so the answer here is [0, 1]
